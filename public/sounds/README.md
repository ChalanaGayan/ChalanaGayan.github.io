# Windows XP Sounds

To complete the Windows XP experience, add the following sound files to this directory:

## Required Sound Files:

1. **windows-xp-startup.mp3** - Plays during boot screen
   - Download from: https://www.soundjay.com/windows-xp-sounds.html
   - Or search for "Windows XP startup sound"

2. **windows-xp-shutdown.mp3** - Optional: Plays when closing windows
   - Download from: https://www.soundjay.com/windows-xp-sounds.html

3. **windows-xp-error.mp3** - Optional: Plays on errors
   - Download from: https://www.soundjay.com/windows-xp-sounds.html

## How to Add Sounds:

1. Download the Windows XP sound files from a royalty-free source
2. Convert them to .mp3 format if needed
3. Place them in this `/public/sounds/` directory
4. The application will automatically play them at the appropriate times

## Alternative:

You can also use any .mp3 files and rename them to match the expected filenames above.

## Note:

The sounds are optional. If the files are not found, the application will continue to work normally without sound.
